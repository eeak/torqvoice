# The npm install above re-resolves the dependency tree and replaces the
# standalone build's PATCHED next package with a fresh unpatched copy from the
# registry, which silently breaks all WebSocket routes (live updates, work
# board sync). Re-apply the next-ws patch so the runtime server can accept
# WebSocket upgrades. next-ws itself is already in the standalone bundle.
#
# sharp is named in that install for the same reason. It is the only native
# module in the tree, its binary lives in a platform-specific optional
# dependency (@img/sharp-linuxmusl-x64 on this image), and re-resolving the
# tree can leave the traced copy without one. Installing it by name makes npm
# resolve the binary against the platform the image will actually run on.
RUN npx next-ws patch --yes

# next-ws reads a route module's exports the moment an upgrade arrives, and
# Next 16.3 loads route modules lazily, so the first WebSocket connection after
# every boot died with "The lazy module is still loading" until the fix below
# is applied to the fresh copy the install above pulled in.
